📌  Overview
This project aims to classify cryptocurrencies as High Liquidity or Low Liquidity assets using a supervised machine learning model. Liquidity is a critical metric in cryptocurrency markets — it affects volatility, price stability, and ease of trading. The classification helps investors and exchanges assess the market readiness of digital assets.

🎯 Objective
Predict whether a cryptocurrency has high or low liquidity
Build an interpretable machine learning model
Deploy a Streamlit web app using Render for public interaction

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Random Forest Classifier
Streamlit (for web app interface)
Google Colab (for model training)
Render (for deployment)
GitHub (for version control)

📊 Dataset
Two snapshots (March 16 & 17, 2022) of CoinGecko data
  
Features include:
Price
Volume
Market Cap
% change (1h, 24h, 7d)
Custom engineered features:
log_volume, log_liquidity, momentum_3d, etc.

📈 Model Performance
Algorithm: RandomForestClassifier
Accuracy: ~99.5%
Cross-Validation Score: 99.75%
ROC-AUC: High (plotted)

📦 Deployment
The final model is deployed using Streamlit on Render.
