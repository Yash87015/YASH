**Cryptocurrency Liquidity Classification with Machine Learning**

---

### 📌 Overview

This project aims to classify cryptocurrencies as **High Liquidity** or **Low Liquidity** assets using a supervised machine learning model. Liquidity is a critical metric in cryptocurrency markets — it affects volatility, price stability, and ease of trading. The classification helps investors and exchanges assess the market readiness of digital assets.

### 🎯 Objective

* Predict whether a cryptocurrency has **high or low liquidity**
* Build an interpretable machine learning model
* Deploy a **Streamlit web app** using **Render** for public interaction

---

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
* **Random Forest Classifier**
* **Streamlit** (for web app interface)
* **Google Colab** (for model training)
* **Render** (for deployment)
* **GitHub** (for version control)

### 📊 Dataset

* Two snapshots (`March 16 & 17, 2022`) of CoinGecko data
* Features include:

  * Price
  * Volume
  * Market Cap
  * % change (1h, 24h, 7d)
* Custom engineered features:

  * `log_volume`, `log_liquidity`, `momentum_3d`, etc.
